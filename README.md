## Project Description: 
For this project, I created four differnt tiles by using Mapbox. 
First tile is adjusted basemap. I used dark gray base map and adjust the fonts color and color of some layer. But I tried to keep the map design as simple as I can. Maximum zoom size for this tile is ***14***.

Second tile is dot density map of parks in the Washington state. Each green dots represent nature park, hiking courses, and other outdoor acticities that you can visit including bathrooms. For this tile, maximum zoom size is ***14*** too. This map tells us that there is not that nature park in the city side of the map. Places where categorize as suburban area has more park for outdoor activities.

Thrid tile is the combined layer of base map that I created for first tile and dot density map for second tile. The maximum zoom level is ***14***. As you can see the map, area where green dots clustered is around the white area where it represents the green places. It proves that where park located is also surrounded by the nature.

The last tile is my original map that I created by the Mapbox. The theme of the map is theme color of Huskies. I use the base color as the purple and uses goldish yellow color for the highways and green nature part of the map is light purple to add a gradation to the map. The maximum zoom size of this tile is also ***14***.
